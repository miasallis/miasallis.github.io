            <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p class="left">Ever since I was young I have always been involved in sports. 
                As of right now I am in a volleyball and tennis club. I've played tennis for nearly 10 years now.
                In tennis I assist in coaching the younger students at the club. Volleyball is a newer sport to me with having played it for 2 years however, I thoroughly enjoy it and have met wonderful people through it

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p class="left">Another interest of mine is music. I always listen to music and it has led me to learning the flute and guitar. 
                For the flute I have had lessons from a young age and am currently going onto grade 6. Contrastingly, I am self-taught on the guitar and have been playing for nearly a year now. 
                Music is most definitely a passion of mine with my electric guitar being the item I saved up for for quite a long time.
            </p>
            <h2>Creative</h2>
            <p class="left">Lastly, I enjoy many different activity which let me express my creativity. These include: crochet, cooking and drawing.
                Crochet is something I picked up a few years ago from my grandma and have made many items for my friends and family. 
                Cooking is another hobby of mine which I've done since I was young. I particularly enjoy experimenting with new recipes and perfecting those that I like. 
                Finally, drawing is something I do in my spare time to unwind and I particularly enjoy drawing characters from books or shows that I like.
